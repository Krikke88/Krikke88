- 👋 Hi, I’m @Krikke88.
- 👀 I’m interested in recovering data from a busted WD MyBook. I am a hobby photographer and have pictures of my friend's family on the drive, and sadly her husband passed away two days ago.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about decryption to discover the drive does not encrypt.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting those photos to my friend, and maybe coding in the future.
- 📫 How to reach me kristien_coteur@hotmail.com
